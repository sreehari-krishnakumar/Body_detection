# Body_detection
Hello  guys,

Here we use opencv in python to recognize a human body.

The requirements are given bellow. 
Run the give lines in your terminal:

        pip install opencv-python
        pip install opencv-contrib-python
        pip install numpy
        
        
next run the program which you can download from the repository and it should work out fine.


Thank you.
